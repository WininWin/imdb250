##CS498rk Art and Science of Web programming 

One of my websites I built for Web Programming project. The site will show the top 250 movies from the IMDB, using Angular JS. It has three partial views: Lists, Details, and Gallery. Lists view has the all movies. Details view has the detail of the specific movie. Gallery view has the thumbnails of the movies. The data format for movies is JSON.
